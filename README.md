# MaxMSP-Examples
A series of test patches, solutions, and fun oddities in Max/MSP

All code provided is in Max/MSP compressed form. Simply copy the code and paste it into any Max patcher, and it should appear exactly as I have formatted it, with all comments included.

This repository includes a number of signal processing modules as well as routing tools and some fun little side projects. Each of these is fully customizable and can also be made into a standalone application. The complete toolbox is especially useful for making new and interesting sounds on the fly, and could be combined with a simple record module to save the work.
